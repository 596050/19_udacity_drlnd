# Deep Reinforcement Learning
Learn cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning algorithmsâ€”from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). Apply these concepts to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex tasks, and build a robust portfolio of deep reinforcement learning projects.

## Structure
### Foundations of Reinforcement Learning
Master the fundamentals of reinforcement learning by writing your own implementations of many classical solution methods.

### Value-Based Methods
Apply deep learning architectures to reinforcement learning tasks. Train your own agent that navigates a virtual world from sensory data.

### Policy-Based Methods
Learn the theory behind evolutionary algorithms and policy-gradient methods. Design your own algorithm to train a simulated robotic arm to reach target locations.

### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Learn how to apply reinforcement learning methods to applications that involve multiple, interacting agents. These techniques are used in a variety of applications, such as the coordination of autonomous vehicles.
